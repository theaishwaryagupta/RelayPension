# RelayPension

This is an Android Aplication for managing old age Pension Appliactions.
It was developed during my participation in Smart india Hackathon 2018.
Problem Statement : - https://innovate.mygov.in/sih_ps/department-is-currently-enrolling-all-old-age-pension-scheme-beneficiaries-online-through-e-district-portal-the-scheme-has-a-finite-number-of-vacancies-for-each-constituency-therefore-once-the-avai/

This was developed by a team of six members.
In this app we tried to manage the complete process for handeling pension applications.
We created one module for administration, in which we could see rejected applications, new applications and closed applications. 
All of this was working in realtime with the help of Google firebase.
Also, we focused on ease of use as thw target audience for this application are elderly people, who might find it difficult to use a mobile application.
We made the sign up process super easy as we fetched all the details of the user from Aadhar.
Since we didn't have the access to actuall API, we did create a dummy database to store user information.
Also we have used shared prefferences to maintain the user session, it is very secure as well.
