# RelayPension

This is an Android Aplication for managing old age Pension Appliactions.
It was developed during my participation in Smart india Hackathon 2018.
Problem Statement : - https://innovate.mygov.in/sih_ps/department-is-currently-enrolling-all-old-age-pension-scheme-beneficiaries-online-through-e-district-portal-the-scheme-has-a-finite-number-of-vacancies-for-each-constituency-therefore-once-the-avai/


In this app we tried to manage the complete process for handeling pension applications.
We created one module for administration, in which we could see rejected applications, new applications and closed applications. 
All of this was working in realtime with the help of Google firebase.
